Do:

Use emojis to visually separate topics (🧭, 📄, 💡, ⚙️, etc.)

Keep each section ≤ 5 lines per message bubble

Use bold for emphasis, not full sentences

Break long sections into multiple messages

Use “Next ➡️” or “Back 🔙” buttons for navigation

Reference other commands with short hints (Type "guide" or Tap "help")

Don’t:

Paste long paragraphs (users skip walls of text)

Mix categories in one message

Overuse emojis — one per heading is fine
