IMPORTANT CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY):
This is a production Next.js website deployed on Vercel.
All changes will be pushed to Git and auto-deployed.
This task is strictly for SEO internal linking improvements.

🚨 CRITICAL RULE — DO NOT TOUCH SLUGS 🚨
- DO NOT rename, modify, or restructure ANY existing URLs or routes.
- DO NOT change page slugs, folder names, or dynamic routes.
- DO NOT introduce redirects.
- DO NOT suggest “better” URL names.
- ALL internal links MUST use the existing, current slugs exactly as they are.

Changing slugs will harm SEO and is NOT allowed.

------------------------------------

TASK:
Implement a clear, consistent INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY across https://www.ipprotectionindia.com to improve SEO and topical authority.

DO NOT:
- Change existing URLs or slugs (ABSOLUTELY NO SLUG CHANGES)
- Remove or rewrite existing content
- Break layout, styling, or components
- Introduce new pages or routes
- Add nofollow to internal links

DO:
1. On EVERY service page:
- Add contextual internal links to:
a) At least 2 other RELATED service pages
b) At least 1–2 relevant blog articles (if available)
- Links must be embedded naturally inside paragraph content.

2. On EVERY blog article:
- Add at least 2 contextual internal links pointing to relevant service pages.
- Add at least 1 internal link to another related blog article.

3. Anchor text rules:
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text.
- Avoid generic anchors like "click here", "read more", or "learn more".
- Example GOOD anchor text:
- "online patent filing services in India"
- "patentability search services"
- "freedom to operate (FTO) analysis"

4. Placement rules:
- Place links within body content (not footer-only).
- Prefer linking inside:
- Service explanation sections
- Process / workflow sections
- FAQ answers
- Limit internal links to a maximum of 3–5 per page.

5. Technical implementation:
- Use Next.js <Link> component for ALL internal links.
- Ensure links are crawlable (standard href, no JS-only handlers).
- Preserve all existing SEO metadata (titles, meta descriptions, schema).

6. Quality checks before finalizing:
- Ensure NO broken links.
- Ensure links are contextually relevant.
- Avoid repetitive anchor text across the same page.
- Avoid circular linking spam.

GOAL:
Create a clean internal linking structure where:
- Blog content supports service pages
- Service pages reference each other logically
- Google can clearly understand topical relationships
- SEO authority flows naturally across the site
