IMPORTANT CONTEXT (READ FIRST):

This is a production website built with React + Next.js and deployed on Vercel.
All changes will be pushed to Git and auto-deployed.
This task is ONLY for improving SEO content on the /contact page.
DO NOT change routing, slugs, components, or layout structure.

🚨 CRITICAL RULES 🚨
- DO NOT change the URL or route (/contact must remain unchanged)
- DO NOT rename files or folders
- DO NOT break existing layout, styling, or form functionality
- DO NOT add new pages
- DO NOT add heavy content or long paragraphs
- DO NOT keyword stuff

------------------------------------

TASK:
Improve the SEO content of the /contact page to strengthen:
1) Service relevance
2) Online IP services intent
3) Internal linking to core service pages
4) Trust and clarity for users

------------------------------------

IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING CHANGES EXACTLY:

1) H1 UPDATE
If the page currently uses a generic H1 like "Contact Us",
replace it with:

"Contact IP Protection India – Online Intellectual Property Services"

(Ensure there is only ONE H1 on the page.)

------------------------------------

2) INTRO PARAGRAPH (PLACE DIRECTLY BELOW H1)

Replace any existing generic intro text with a concise 60–80 word paragraph that:
- Mentions online delivery
- Mentions core IP services
- Mentions pan-India availability
- Sounds professional and neutral

Suggested content (can be lightly adapted but keep intent):

"Contact IP Protection India for online patent, trademark, copyright, and intellectual property services across India. We assist startups, businesses, and innovators with end-to-end IP protection, filing, and advisory services through a fully digital process. Our team ensures timely support, transparent communication, and compliance with applicable IP laws."

------------------------------------

3) ADD A QUALIFYING SECTION ABOVE THE CONTACT FORM

Insert a new section ABOVE the form with:

H2:
"When Should You Contact IP Protection India?"

Content (use a clean bullet list):

* To file a patent or trademark online  
* To conduct a patentability or freedom-to-operate (FTO) search  
* To protect software, designs, or creative works  
* To get cost estimates for IP filing in India  
* To consult an IP expert before filing  

------------------------------------

4) INTERNAL LINKING (VERY IMPORTANT)

Below the bullet list, add a short paragraph with INTERNAL LINKS to key service pages.

Rules:
- Use Next.js <Link> component
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Link ONLY to core service pages
- Do NOT add nofollow

Example sentence structure (adapt links to existing routes):

"If you are looking for specific services, you may explore our Online Patent Filing Services, Patentability Search, or Trademark Registration Services pages for detailed information."

------------------------------------

5) LOCATION CONTEXT (LIGHT TOUCH)

Before the address / map section, add ONE short line:

"We serve clients across India through online consultations, with operational support from our offices in Bangalore and other locations."

Do NOT add city keyword stuffing.

------------------------------------

6) OPTIONAL FAQ (ONLY 2–3 QUESTIONS MAX)

If space allows without clutter, add a small FAQ section near the bottom:

H2: "Frequently Asked Questions"

Q1: Can I file a patent online through IP Protection India?  
A: Yes, we provide end-to-end online patent filing services in India, including consultation, drafting, and filing.

Q2: Do you provide services across India?  
A: Yes, our services are delivered online, allowing us to assist clients across India regardless of location.

------------------------------------

7) META DATA (IF MANAGED IN CODE)

If meta title and description are defined in this page component, update to:

Meta Title:
"Contact IP Protection India | Online IP & Patent Filing Services"

Meta Description:
"Contact IP Protection India for online patent filing, trademark registration & IP advisory services across India. Speak to an IP expert today."

------------------------------------

FINAL CHECKS BEFORE COMMIT:
- No route or slug changes
- No layout breakage
- No form logic changes
- Content remains clean and readable
- Internal links resolve correctly
- Only light, purposeful SEO content added

GOAL:
Make the /contact page a strong SEO support + conversion page,
NOT a primary ranking page.
