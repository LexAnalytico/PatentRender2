I am on the verge of copleting patent filing services and will advance to the next stage which is trademark, copyright and design services. I am thinking could I have a message box similar to the one used in admin dashboard and user dashbord to do following:
for trademark, copyright and design services the interactive message box will list out the services and cost instead of user seleting from UI
This is not a chatbot but preselected messages and use of api to get and display required info and also to guide user to the correct screen examle razorpay for payment, forms, invoices and user dashboard and is this a workable solution or should I stick to UI?


Here’s a concise, high-level text-based block diagram you can share with management to approve the guided “Service Message Panel” approach.

Concept overview
A scripted, message-like guide (not a chatbot) that presents Trademark, Design, and Copyright services with prices and clear next actions: Pay, Fill Forms, View Invoice, or Go to Dashboard. It reuses your existing APIs, pricing rules, checkout (Razorpay), forms, invoices, and user dashboard.

System blocks (text diagram)
User | v Entry points (Header/Sections/Buttons)

"Guided selection" for Trademark/Design/Copyright | v Service Guide Launcher
Determines category (TM/C/Design)
Loads service list + pricing | v ServiceGuidePanel (scripted UI, not chat)
Lists services (name + price)
Shows selection summary + Total
Action buttons: [Pay Now] [Fill Forms] [View Invoice] [Go to Dashboard] | +--> Pay Now ------------------------------+ | |
| v v | CheckoutLayer (Razorpay) Forms Router (existing) | - Create order (server) - Opens correct form(s) | - Open Razorpay - Pre-fill where possible | - Verify payment (webhook/API) - Save drafts/submissions | - Update order + receipt - Return to dashboard | | | v | Order/Receipt Store | +--> View Invoice ------------------------> Invoice Builder (existing) | - Build/serve PDF/HTML | - Download or email | +--> Go to Dashboard ---------------------> User Dashboard (existing) | v State/Telemetries (optional)

Local storage (cart, recent selection)
Analytics: guide open, selection, pay intent, success/failure
Logs/Errors (client + server)
Data/Services (reused)

Pricing Rules (compute per category/service)
Orders API (create, verify, retrieve)
Razorpay (payment)
Invoices (HTML/PDF builder)
Forms (existing routes/components)
Key data flows
Pricing: ServiceGuidePanel → Pricing rules (compute/format) → Render list with INR prices.
Payment: Action “Pay Now” → Create order → Razorpay checkout → Verify payment → Update order/receipt.
Forms: Action “Fill Forms” → Route to correct existing form(s) → Save → Dashboard.
Invoice: Action “View Invoice” → Generate invoice with existing builder → Show/Download.
Rollout and risk controls
Feature flag per category (TM/C/Design) to enable/disable guided panel.
Fallback: keep existing UI tiles/cards; show both “Explore UI” and “Guided” to A/B test.
Graceful degradation:
Pricing fetch failure → fallback to static prices + notice.
Payment failure → clear recovery path: retry or contact support.
Network errors → non-blocking banners and retry option.
Security and compliance
Payments via Razorpay only; no card data stored.
Orders tied to authenticated user; use existing Supabase session.
Invoices and forms leverage current access controls.
Logs redact PII; align with Privacy Policy.
Success criteria (metrics)
Conversion: guide open → pay or form-start rate (+X% vs classic UI).
Time-to-first-action: guide open → first click (shorter is better).
Drop-off reduction during selection.
Support tickets about “not sure which option” should decrease.
Implementation scope
Component: ServiceGuidePanel (added)
Props: open, category, services [{id,name,price,desc?}]
Callbacks: onStartPayment, onOpenForm, onViewInvoice, onGoDashboard
Reuses formatINR, CheckoutLayer, forms, invoices, dashboard.
Launcher buttons: small additions in TM/Design/Copyright sections (and/or header).
Wiring: Connect pricing fetch/compute to pass curated service list to the panel.
Maintenance/extendability
Add/update services and prices via existing pricing rules/API.
Update scripted copy per category without code changes to payments or forms.
Add future actions (e.g., “Talk to specialist”) as new buttons.
Visual summary (compact ASCII)
[User] | v [Launcher: Guided Selection] --> [ServiceGuidePanel] | Service list + price | Actions: | - Pay Now -> [CheckoutLayer/Razorpay] -> [Orders/Receipt] | - Fill Forms -> [Forms Router] | - View Invoice -> [Invoice Builder] | - Go to Dashboard -> [User Dashboard] | +-- uses [Pricing Rules/API], [Auth], [Logs/Analytics]

This plan is intentionally low-risk: it layers a lightweight, guided surface over your existing, proven flows—payments, forms, invoices, and dashboard—so you can ship fast and iterate based on actual usage.
